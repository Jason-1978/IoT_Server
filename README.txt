This is my personal work in progress meant initially only for myself to enable git repo management from the start and facilitate file transfer between my machines. 

This is intended to be based upon Paho-MQTT and HAP-python to initially enable use with the ESP8266, but I fully intend to incorporate Arduino, etc. in the future as my needs and interests continue to grow. 

I currently have no guidance except my own interest and passion so my code may not be ideal to learn from and I would happily take any critique of it. Thanks
